Adopted Zimlets and developments
================================

Introduction
------------

This repository holds zimlets, that were adopted by developers by seemingly or actual orphaned zimlets.

If you have other zimlets, that you've updated but can't reach the author so he/she could update the gallery, please
send a pull request to have them included here.

The zimlets available here mostly are more compatible with current Zimbra versions and have bugs fixed and 
new features added.

Zimbra-Support
--------------

These zimlets work in the latest Zimbra 8.0-release.

Support for 8.5 is currently in development (see [issue 10](https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/adopted/issues/10)).

Using the zimlets
-----------------

To use the zimlets, you'll have to package them yourself. If you're on a Unix-ish system, you can simply use
the makedist.sh script to generate zip-files for distribution.

If not:

Create a zip-file with the same name as the zimlet containing **only** the files in the subdirectory of it,
**not** the directory itself.

For example if you want to use the archive zimlet, create a zip-file "ca_uoguelph_ccs_archive.zip" containing
all files **within** the ca_uoguelph_ccs_archive.zip-subdirectory.
